## Goals
[] constant currentline readout, simliar to vim.
[] keybind for save, open, exit
[x] parse args to open file syntax : program somefile.txt.1
[] fix tab issue. if possible -> using only spaces.
[] proper sketch area
[] formatting issue
[] check if file changed with length(somewhat bad practice.) check if file is saved, assuming that if the length of the file changed, then the file is different.
[] start open at what file in path was executed.
